# azure-cv-functions

Functions using the Azure Computer Vision.

## Remarks

Microsoft provides a client library from [GitHub: Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python). It is better for us to use this library. You can use the Python module [azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/) as follows:

```sh
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
```
